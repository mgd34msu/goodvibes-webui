# Approval actions from a push notification

When the daemon fans out a pending approval as a Web Push message, the operator
shell shows it with two action buttons: **Allow** and **Deny**.

## What ships today (works against the current daemon)

- **In-app buttons.** The Approvals view (`ApprovalsTasksView`) has Approve /
  Deny / Claim / Cancel buttons backed by the real `approvals.*` operator
  methods. This is the primary way to decide an approval and needs nothing new.
- **Notification action buttons that hand off to the app.** The service worker
  (`public/sw.js`) adds `Allow` / `Deny` buttons to an approval notification.
  Tapping one opens the app at
  `/?view=approvals-tasks#approval-action=<approve|deny>&approval-id=<id>`.
  The app — which holds the operator token — reads that fragment on open,
  runs the real `approvals.approve` / `approvals.deny` call, scrubs the
  fragment, and toasts the result. See:
  - `src/lib/push/notification-link.ts` (and the hand-kept copy in
    `public/sw.js`) — builds the deep link.
  - `src/lib/push/approval-action-link.ts` — parses and strips the fragment.
  - `ApprovalsTasksView` `ApprovalsSection` — the mount-once hand-off effect.

Platforms without notification-action support simply omit the buttons and a
body tap still opens the approvals list — a graceful degrade, never a dead tap.

## What is deliberately NOT built (and why)

**One-tap background decide** — approving or denying straight from the
notification *without opening a window* — is intentionally left out. A service
worker cannot make that call today:

- The service worker holds **no operator token**. The token lives in
  `localStorage` (`createBrowserTokenStore`), which a service worker cannot
  read. So the worker cannot authenticate an `approvals.approve` / `.deny`
  request on its own.
- We will **not** fake it (e.g. fire an unauthenticated request that silently
  fails, or cache a long-lived token in the worker).

Because of that, the hand-off above is the honest ceiling: the authenticated
app always makes the real call.

## Daemon API needed to close the gap

To let the service worker decide an approval in the background, the daemon would
need to issue a **single-purpose, single-use action token** scoped to exactly
one approval decision, and carry it in the push payload:

1. When the daemon fans out the approval push, include per-action tokens in the
   payload `data`, e.g.:

   ```json
   {
     "title": "Approval needed: run tests",
     "body": "...",
     "data": {
       "kind": "approval",
       "approvalId": "appr-123",
       "actionTokens": { "approve": "<jwt>", "deny": "<jwt>" }
     }
   }
   ```

   Each token must be: bound to that one `approvalId`; valid for a single use;
   short-lived (expires with the approval); and usable for **only** the
   approve/deny of that approval — nothing else.

2. Expose an endpoint that accepts such a token instead of the operator bearer,
   e.g. `POST /api/approvals/{approvalId}/{approve|deny}` authenticated by an
   `Authorization: Bearer <actionToken>` (or a dedicated header), returning the
   updated approval record.

With those two pieces, `public/sw.js`'s `notificationclick` handler could
`fetch` the decision directly (no window) when `event.action` is `approve` /
`deny`, falling back to the current app hand-off when a token is absent or the
platform lacks action support. Until the daemon offers this, the
background-decide path stays unbuilt behind that capability check.
