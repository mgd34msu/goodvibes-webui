/**
 * assert-contract-shape.ts — binds the e2e fixtures (seed.ts / mock-daemon.ts)
 * to the SDK's generated operator-contract.json, the SAME artifact
 * src/lib/goodvibes.test.ts's `bridge-matches-schema` suite (L354, assertConforms)
 * walks. The e2e harness is hermetic by design (never hits a port — see
 * mock-daemon.ts's header) and models real wire shapes, but nothing PINNED the
 * fixtures to the SDK contract, so a method rename or a reshaped envelope on the real
 * contract still passed the e2e mock green (the provider-pills incident: seed.ts's
 * providers.list fixture once invented a top-level `authenticated`/`freshnessSeconds`
 * the wire never sends — see providersResponse()'s header in seed.ts). This module
 * closes that gap for the response shapes the e2e mock hands back.
 *
 * DESIGN — deliberately a lightweight per-method OUTPUT shape check, not a full JSON
 * Schema validator (see the brief's risk note: right-size to how often the contract
 * moves). It mirrors assertConforms's exact walk and its exact intentional gaps:
 *   - Only descends into `properties` (objects) and `items` (arrays); an `anyOf` node
 *     (e.g. a nullable field) is treated as an opaque primitive — its OWN presence is
 *     checked by the parent's `required` list, but not walked further. Same trade-off
 *     assertConforms makes, for the same reason: many `anyOf` nodes in this contract
 *     don't reduce to a single structurally-checkable shape.
 *   - Enum values and primitive TYPES are not checked, only field PRESENCE — a schema
 *     rename (dropped/renamed required field) or a newly-required field are what this
 *     catches; a value going from `string` to `number` on an existing field is not.
 *   - additionalProperties:false nodes reject an invented field; additionalProperties
 *     left permissive (true/absent) does not.
