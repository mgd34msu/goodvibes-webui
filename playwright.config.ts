/**
 * Playwright harness, the phone-viewport (390x844) proof standard this repo's
 * visual proofs defer to, plus a desktop project to catch regressions.
 *
 * WHAT IS SERVED: a production build of THIS repo (`vite build`, then `vite preview`),
 * the same bundle the release ships, not the vite dev server. The dev server hands
 * each page ~340 separately transformed modules; on a 4-vCPU CI runner with four
 * browsers loading them at once, the app took ~11 s to boot, past the 10 s expect
 * timeout (CI run 36775763838, tailscale-serve.e2e.ts:100). A build is a handful of
 * chunks, boots in well under a second, and is what users actually run.
 *
 * HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION: the preview serves on a dedicated port (4318,
 * deliberately NOT 3421 or 4444) and points its /api proxy at a
 * local STUB (scripts/e2e-daemon-stub.ts, port 59991) that answers every request with
 * a deliberate 503 { code: 'E2E_STUB' }, never a real daemon. In practice the stub is
 * almost never reached: every test installs an in-page mock (installMockDaemon /
 * installChatMockDaemon) that intercepts the wire in the browser and answers from a
 * seeded fixture. The stub exists for the one structural exception, requests made
 * while a REAL service worker controls the page (the PWA specs), which Playwright
 * page routing cannot see, so nothing ever dies as a refused connection and a clean
 * run's webServer log is silent. No real daemon, no real network beyond the local
 * preview server, no port coordination.

 * deliberately a REAL bind + a REAL browser navigation, not a mocked window.location:
 * Chromium's own secure-context determination is a fact about the literal address the
 * page was actually served from, and no in-page mock can fake that. Undefined when the
