/**
 * project-temp.ts — scratch-directory helper for this repo's own tests.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: tests that call `mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), prefix))`
 * scatter scratch directories across the REAL OS tmpfs. Cleanup normally
 * happens in `afterEach`/`finally`, but that code never runs if the process
 * is killed by a signal (CI cancellation, a timeout kill, ctrl-C) — so the
 * directories accumulate forever. This is not hypothetical: it happened for
 * real across this ecosystem's repos and exhausted /tmp's inode table
 * (1,048,436 of 1,048,576 inodes in use) from roughly 40 distinct leak
 * prefixes. This repo's contribution to that was small — 3 call sites when
 * this was written — but the same failure mode applies here.
 *
 * This module gives the two remaining call sites
 * (scripts/internal-identifier-check.test.ts, scripts/sdk-dev.test.ts) one
 * place to create and clean up scratch directories:
 *
 *   - `makeProjectTempDir` roots scratch dirs under an in-repo `.test-tmp/`
 *     directory (already gitignored) instead of the shared OS tmpdir, so a
 *     leaked directory only ever competes with THIS repo's own runs, is easy
 *     to find (`ls .test-tmp`), and can be swept without any risk of
 *     touching another project's leftovers in the shared /tmp.
 *
 *   - It registers the directory for best-effort removal via
 *     `process.on('exit', ...)`. This mirrors what a normal
 *     `afterEach`/`finally` already does and does NOT add any new
 *     guarantee — a SIGKILL skips 'exit' handlers exactly like it skips
 *     `afterAll`. The actual backstop for that case is `sweepStaleProjectTempDirs`
 *     below, run before the suite via the `pretest` hook (see package.json).
 *
 *   - `sweepStaleProjectTempDirs` removes only directories whose basename
 *     starts with one of THIS repo's own known prefixes, only when they are
 *     older than a threshold, from both roots. It is intentionally narrow:
 *     no blanket tmpdir sweep, ever.
 *
 * THE THIRD CALL SITE IS GONE: scripts/live-daemon-smoke.ts used to take its
 * daemon home/work dirs from a `makeRealTempDir` helper here, rooted at the
 * real `os.tmpdir()`. It now puts both under `.test-tmp/run-<pid>` via
 * scripts/test-temp-root.ts and has scripts/live-daemon-smoke-runner.ts
 * delete that root from a parent process once the child has fully exited —
 * a deterministic removal this module's exit hook could not provide (the
 * daemon's teardown flush beat it, measured 3/3 runs). `makeRealTempDir` was
 * removed with its last caller rather than left as an unused escape hatch
 * back into the shared tmpdir. Its two prefixes stay in KNOWN_TEMP_PREFIXES
 * below so the sweep still reaps directories older runs left there.
