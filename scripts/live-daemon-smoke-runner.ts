/**
 * live-daemon-smoke-runner — runs the live smoke in a child process and removes
 * its scratch tree once that process is genuinely gone.
 *
 * WHY A PARENT PROCESS RATHER THAN MORE CLEANUP INSIDE THE SMOKE: the daemon the
 * smoke boots flushes its activity log (`workdir/.goodvibes/logs/activity.md`)
 * during process teardown, at a point that no in-process cleanup can reliably
 * come after. Every in-process attempt was measured, and every one of them left
 * the tree on disk:
 *
 *   1. rmSync in main()'s `finally`          -> leaked (3/3 runs)
 *   2. a settle loop after the last await    -> leaked (3/3 runs)
 *   3. a process.on('exit') handler          -> leaked (3/3 runs)
 *
 * The flush wins that race, and whether it wins was even sensitive to whether
 * stdout was a pipe — which is the definition of a fix that is not a fix. From a
 * PARENT, there is no race at all: the child has exited, so nothing is left that
 * could write. The smoke keeps its own cleanup for the case where it is run
 * directly (`bun run scripts/live-daemon-smoke.ts`), and the start-of-run sweep
 * remains the backstop for a run killed hard enough to take this parent with it.
