/**
 * live-daemon-smoke.ts — exercise the webui's own transport + stream code against a REAL
 * daemon process, not mocks.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE LANE: the default `bun test` unit lane is hermetic (happy-dom + in-page
 * mocks) and must stay that way. This lane boots a real daemon from the local SDK dev-link
 * (bootDaemon: isolated home, ephemeral loopback port, bearer-token auth), points the
 * webui's actual SDK client (src/lib/goodvibes.ts) at it, and drives a minimal session
 * round-trip end to end — proving the real request/response and Server-Sent-Event paths
 * work against a genuine daemon. It is wired as `bun run test:live`, NOT under the default
 * test glob, so the unit lane never spawns a process.
 *
 * It is deliberately model-free: it creates and lists a session and opens the live event
 * stream (all real daemon state), so it needs no provider credential and runs green offline.
 * Sending a message that requires an LLM turn is out of scope here precisely because that
 * WOULD need an external credential.
 *
 * Run: `bun run test:live`  (or `bun run scripts/live-daemon-smoke.ts`)

 * covers a run that finishes (pass or fail) and nothing else: interrupt it with
 * Ctrl-C or let CI time it out and both trees stayed in the system temp with
 * nobody to remove them.
 *
 * Now both live under one parent inside the repo's gitignored `.test-tmp/run-<pid>`.
 * Three things remove it, in descending order of reliability:
 *   1. scripts/live-daemon-smoke-runner.ts, the parent `bun run test:live` starts —
 *      deterministic, because it deletes after THIS process has fully exited;
 *   2. the in-process cleanup below (SIGINT/SIGTERM, and an exit handler) — best
 *      effort, and measured to lose a race against the daemon's teardown flush;
 *   3. sweepStaleRunRoots() at the start of the next test run, which reaps any
 *      root whose owning pid is gone.
 * One parent directory instead of two siblings also means a failure BETWEEN the
 * two creations can no longer strand the first one.
