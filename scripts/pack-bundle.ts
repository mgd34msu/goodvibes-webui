/**
 * pack-bundle — turn the built `dist/` into the release asset the suite
 * installer downloads.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The browser operator surface installs alongside the daemon, the terminal app
 * and the agent from one curl. It is the only one of the four that is not a
 * binary — it is static files the daemon serves on its own listener — so what it
 * publishes is a bundle: one gzipped tar, named for its version, attached to the
 * GitHub release with a SHA256SUMS.txt the installer verifies it against, on
 * exactly the same terms as every binary in the suite. A missing manifest entry
 * is a hard failure there, never a skip.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS PART OF THE CONTRACT
 *
 * The archive holds a single top-level directory, `goodvibes-webui/`, containing
 * `index.html` and everything beside it. The installer unpacks to a scratch
 * directory, checks `goodvibes-webui/index.html` exists, and only then moves it
 * into place — so an interrupted download can never leave a half-extracted
 * directory that a daemon then serves as if it were an app. `index.html` is what
 * the daemon serves at `/` and falls back to for app routes; an archive without
 * it is not a bundle, and this script refuses to produce one.
 *
 * IT IS DETERMINISTIC ON PURPOSE
 *
 * Two runs over the same `dist/` produce byte-identical archives: entries are
 * sorted, ownership is zeroed, timestamps are pinned to the epoch, and gzip is
 * told not to record its own. Without that the checksum in SHA256SUMS.txt would
 * differ between a re-run and the run that shipped, and "the bytes are the ones
 * this release built" would stop being checkable.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/pack-bundle.ts                 # writes release/ from dist/
 *   bun run scripts/pack-bundle.ts --dist <dir> --out <dir> --version <x.y.z>
