/**
 * sweep-stale-temp.ts — CLI entry point for scripts/helpers/project-temp.ts's
 * sweepStaleProjectTempDirs. Wired as the `pretest` script (see package.json),
 * so it runs once before every `bun run test`, including the CI "Run tests"
 * step in .github/workflows/ci.yml — the CI "Coverage" step that follows
 * calls `bun test` directly (bypassing the pretest hook), but by then this
 * sweep has already run once for the job.
 *
 * Prints what it removed (if anything) and always exits 0 — a sweep that can
 * fail the build is worse than a sweep that occasionally leaves a directory
 * for next time.
