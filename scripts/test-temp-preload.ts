/**
 * test-temp-preload — the bun test preload entry that performs the temp-directory
 * redirect described in scripts/test-temp-root.ts.
 *
 * This file exists SEPARATELY from test-temp-root.ts so the redirect is a
 * consequence of bunfig.toml preloading it, and of nothing else. When the sweep
 * and the redirect lived at the top of test-temp-root.ts, importing that module
 * (which its own test does) performed them — so the test asserting "os.tmpdir()
 * points inside the repo" passed even with the preload entry removed from
 * bunfig.toml. A guard that its subject cannot escape is not a guard.
 *
 * Runs first in bunfig.toml's [test] preload list, before src/test-setup.ts and
 * before any test module.
