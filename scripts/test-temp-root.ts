/**
 * test-temp-root — give the test run its own temp directory inside the repo,
 * and reap what earlier runs left behind.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM: nothing in this repo pointed the test run's temp directory
 * anywhere, so `os.tmpdir()` resolved to the system temp dir. Every directory a
 * test creates there is invisible to the repo, ignored by .gitignore, and swept
 * by nobody. Today's suite happens to clean up after itself on a green run
 * (measured — see test-temp-root.test.ts), but two things were still true:
 * a run that is KILLED (Ctrl-C, a CI timeout) leaves its directories in the
 * system temp forever, and the next test to reach for `os.tmpdir()` inherits the
 * same unswept ground.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES, and deliberately does not do:
 *   - Points TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP at `<repo>/.test-tmp/run-<pid>` (gitignored) before
 *     any test module is evaluated, so `os.tmpdir()` and every child process
 *     spawned by a test land inside the repo instead of the system temp.
 *   - Sweeps `.test-tmp/run-*` roots whose owning process is GONE. That is the
 *     recovery path for a killed run, and it is why this file does not try to
 *     delete the current run's root on the way out: under `bun test --isolate`
 *     every test FILE re-runs this preload in the SAME process, so an `afterAll`
 *     here fires once per file — deleting the run root there would pull the
 *     ground out from under the files still to come. Liveness, checked at
 *     startup, reaps exactly the abandoned roots and never a live sibling run.
 *
 * Wired as the FIRST entry of bunfig.toml's [test] preload, so it runs before
 * src/test-setup.ts and before any test module.
