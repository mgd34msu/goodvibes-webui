/**
 * DaemonUnreachableGate — the honest "can't reach the daemon" state.
 *
 * When auth.current fails with a NETWORK error (the daemon is down or unreachable) and a
 * token is still stored, the app must NOT fall through to the sign-in front door: that
 * wrongly implies the operator is signed out and invites them to re-paste a token that
 * was never the problem. Instead we keep the stored token untouched and show this plain
 * unreachable state. The auth query keeps re-probing while unreachable (App wires a
 * conditional refetchInterval), so the shell reveals itself automatically the moment the
 * daemon answers again — no user action required. A manual "Retry now" is offered for
 * impatience.
