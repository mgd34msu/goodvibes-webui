/**
 * PairingQrScanner, scan a pairing QR with this device's camera.
 *
 * This is the replacement for the retired Android companion app, whose whole
 * job was pointing a camera at the QR that `goodvibes pair` (or the desktop
 * app's pairing panel) puts on a screen. A phone browser can do the same thing,
 * with one condition the native app did not have: the camera needs a secure
 * context, so a web UI served over plain http cannot scan. That case gets its
 * own wording pointing at Tailscale, because it is the difference between "this
 * is broken" and "serve the app over HTTPS and it works".
 *
 * The component only DECODES and PARSES. It hands a validated ScannedPairing to
 * onScanned and lets the sign-in screen route it into the paths it already has;
 * it never signs anyone in itself, and it never reads or renders the secret it
 * just carried.
 *
 * Camera hygiene: the stream is stopped on cancel, on a successful scan, and in
 * the effect cleanup that runs on unmount. Combined with Modal unmounting its
 * children when closed, that means the camera is never live while the dialog is
 * not on screen.
