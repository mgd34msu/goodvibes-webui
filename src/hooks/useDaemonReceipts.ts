/**
 * useDaemonReceipts — consume the daemon's undelivered receipts exactly once
 * per connect and expose them as dismissible notices.
 *
 * The daemon holds a small queue of one-line receipts (a crash restart, a
 * self-update, a migration) and hands them over — marking them delivered — only
 * when control.status is called with { receipts: 'consume' }. This hook fires
 * that consuming call on the ATTACH EDGE (the transition into connected +
 * signed-in), never on the recurring health poll, so plain status reads stay
 * receipt-neutral and each receipt surfaces exactly once.
 *
 * Belt-and-suspenders: every id ever surfaced is remembered, so a dismissed
 * receipt — or one seen on a prior connect — never re-appears even if a
 * reconnect re-consumes. A failed consume marks nothing delivered daemon-side,
 * so it is retried on the next attach edge.
