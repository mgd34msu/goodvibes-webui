/**
 * useOriginPosture — the honest TLS/capability posture of THIS surface's own origin
 * (SDK 1.8.0's LAN-http posture work, pairing.posture.get).
 *
 * A plain-http origin on a private network (a LAN IP, a .local name, localhost) is a
 * supported posture: the app works, but three browser-gated capabilities — service
 * worker/PWA install, push, microphone — are unavailable there, each labeled with the
 * daemon's OWN "needs https — available via tailscale" wording rather than a client-
 * fabricated guess. This hook fetches that posture ONCE for `window.location.origin`
 * (an origin's posture cannot change within a session — a browser reload is the only
 * way this page's own scheme/host could ever change) and every consumer (MicButton,
 * NotificationSettings, the pairing hand-off flow) reads the same cached result rather
 * than each re-deriving it.
 *
 * Requires an authenticated principal (the route 401s otherwise) — callers gate
 * `enabled` on their own auth state; it defaults to true for call sites that only ever
 * mount post-sign-in (MicButton, NotificationSettings).
