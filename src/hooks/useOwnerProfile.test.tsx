/**
 * useOwnerProfile — what the write hooks actually SEND on the wire.
 *
 * This file exists because the panel's own tests mock these hooks, so they assert what the
 * UI does with an answer and can say nothing about the request. A contract change that
 * made `authority` required on every profile write went unnoticed for exactly that reason:
 * a mock that accepts anything accepts a body the daemon would 400. So every assertion
 * here is on the request payload, not on the response.
 *
 * The generated input types cannot catch this either — `authority` is optional in
 * OperatorMethodInput<'profile.set'> and friends (the schemas' `required` arrays do not
 * list it) while routes/owner-profile.ts's readAuthority refuses an absent value at
 * runtime. The handler is stricter than the declared schema, which leaves this test as the
 * only thing standing between a missing authority and a 400 against a real daemon.
