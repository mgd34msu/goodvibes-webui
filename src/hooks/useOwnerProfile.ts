/**
 * useOwnerProfile — the queries and mutations behind the owner-profile settings card
 * (profile.* verbs, docs/owner-profile.md §11.1).
 *
 * Same shape as usePowerStatus/useMemoryDiagnostics: one query per verb, a defensive wire
 * parse in the queryFn (lib/owner-profile.ts's readProfile* readers), and an honest
 * retriable error when the daemon answers 200 with a body that is not a profile. The
 * distinction that matters here is that "the profile could not be read" is a SUCCESSFUL
 * response carrying `state.kind: 'unavailable'` and a reason — not a query error —
 * because §4.4 requires that state to be stated rather than rendered as an empty profile.
 *
 * WHAT EVERY WRITE STATES. Three things, all claims this surface can make honestly:
 *
 *   `authority: 'owner-direct'` — where the fact came from. The daemon requires every
 *      caller to say: routes/owner-profile.ts's readAuthority 400s on an absent or
 *      unrecognised value, and it refuses rather than defaulting because §7 gives forget
 *      and undo an authority check and nothing else, so an unstated authority on a delete
 *      would be no gate at all. This surface can claim owner-direct truthfully because
 *      the only thing that reaches these calls is the owner typing into his own settings
 *      page — no page content, no message body and no document composes them. The agent
 *      must NOT hardcode this; it can genuinely be handed a purported fact by an email or
 *      a web page, and has to state which so the SDK can refuse.
 *   `surface: 'webui'` and `said: '(edited in settings)'` — §9.3's pair, which is what
 *      keeps the resulting line's provenance answerable.
 *
 * `explicitUserRequest` is deliberately NOT sent, and that is not the same call as
 * authority. It lives in an invocation context no transport populates, and
 * refuseNonUserRequest() refuses only an explicit `false` — so sending one would assert
 * something this surface cannot know, and sending `false` would refuse the owner's own
 * click. Authority is a body parameter every caller is already constructing, which is
 * exactly why stating it costs one word and closes a hole.
 *
 * No wire event exists for this domain, so nothing rides useRealtimeInvalidation; each
 * mutation invalidates the whole owner-profile key prefix.
 *
 * CONTAINMENT (§11.3): every value stays in react-query's in-memory cache and in React
 * state. Nothing here writes to localStorage/sessionStorage/IndexedDB, and nothing here
 * logs — a profile value must not reach a console, a persisted cache, or a diagnostic
 * view on this surface.
