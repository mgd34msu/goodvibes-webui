/**
 * usePairingHandoff — turn a `#pair=<token>` fragment into a signed-in session,
 * and — when the link is a hand-off bundle (SDK 1.8.0's pairing.handoff.create,
 * `#pair=<token>&offers=…`) — surface the offer set for a caller to drive
 * (see PairingHandoffOffers, which calls pairing.handoff.complete).
 *
 * When the URL fragment carries a pairing token (the QR from `goodvibes pair` in
 * the terminal, or the newer hand-off bundle), this:
 *   1. captures the token (and any offer set) and strips both from the URL
 *      IMMEDIATELY, so the one-time secret never lingers in the address bar or
 *      a history entry;
 *   2. stores it via the existing token store and validates it against the
 *      daemon's cheap authenticated `auth.current` call (setExplicitAuthToken,
 *      which self-clears a token the daemon rejects);
 *   3. on success, invalidates every query so the shell reveals itself, and —
 *      if the link carried a non-empty offer set — publishes it via `offers` so
 *      the app can render the accept/decline UI. A plain `#pair=<token>` link
 *      (no offers) behaves exactly as before: `offers` stays [].
 *   4. also reads this device's own TLS/capability posture (pairing.posture.get,
 *      SDK 1.8.0's LAN-http posture work) for `window.location.origin` and, when
 *      it carries the one honest plain-http-on-LAN notice line, publishes it via
 *      `postureNotice` — verbatim daemon wording, rendered ONCE by the caller
 *      (App.tsx) and cleared via `dismissPostureNotice`, never re-shown on this
 *      hand-off. A posture read failure is swallowed (this is a nice-to-have
 *      notice, never a blocker on completing the pairing itself).
 *
 * WHY CAPTURE HAPPENS AT MODULE/RENDER TIME, NOT IN AN EFFECT: useUrlState's own
 * mount effect normalizes a bare URL to `?view=chat` and, in doing so, drops the
 * fragment. Its effect runs before this hook's effect (earlier hook order), so an
 * effect here would read an already-stripped hash and lose the token. The capture
 * runs once, synchronously, the first time the hook module is exercised — before
 * any effect — so it always beats that normalization.
 *
 * The status drives first paint: `pending` shows a neutral "pairing" splash
 * INSTEAD of the signed-out gate (no gate flash while the token validates);
 * `error` falls through to the gate, which surfaces the rejection.
