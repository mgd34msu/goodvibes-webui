/**
 * usePushSubscriptionReconcile — reconcile-on-open for Web Push.
 *
 * Fires reconcilePushSubscriptionOnOpen (lib/push/push-client.ts) once on every
 * rising edge into `enabled` (App.tsx passes `health.connection === 'connected'
 * && auth.isSuccess`, mirroring useSessionRealtime/useRealtimeInvalidation's own
 * gate). A rising edge covers both the ordinary app-open case and a daemon
 * reconnect after an outage — either is a legitimate moment to notice that the
 * browser's push endpoint drifted from what the daemon has on record.
 *
 * Also listens for the service worker's `goodvibes-push-subscription-changed`
 * message (public/sw.js's pushsubscriptionchange handler, fired when the
 * browser rotates the endpoint on its own while this tab IS open) and
 * re-reconciles immediately rather than waiting for the next app open — the SW
 * cannot authenticate to the daemon itself (no access to this page's
 * localStorage-held token), so this page is what actually completes the heal.
 * The message's own payload is intentionally ignored; reconcile re-reads the
 * live subscription from PushManager itself, which ordering-wise is guaranteed
 * to already be the rotated one (the SW awaited the resubscribe before
 * posting), so there is nothing to double-carry.
 *
 * Silent by design: this is a background self-heal, not a user-facing action —
 * a failure (daemon hiccup, push unsupported, never subscribed) is swallowed
 * rather than surfaced, exactly like the reconcile function's own honest
 * 'not-subscribed' no-op. Nothing here blocks first paint or shows a spinner.
