/**
 * useVoiceLocalSetup — the managed local-voice provisioning state and one-act install
 * (voice.local.status / voice.local.install, SDK 1.9.0-dev's memory-relay-voice-
 * hardening work).
 *
 * No wire event exists for this domain (unlike power.*, which rides OPS_POWER_STATE_
 * CHANGED) — VoiceSettings refetches manually / on install-mutation success, the same
 * standing gap fleet.*, checkpoints.*, and memory.* document in queries.ts.
 *
 * Live install progress (SDK 5357f09e): while the install mutation is in flight, the
 * status query polls on a short refetchInterval — the same react-query polling idiom
 * FleetView's snapshot uses — because voice.local.status carries an OPTIONAL
 * `installInProgress` section during an active install (the install verb itself stays
 * plain request/response; there is no stream). On an older daemon the section is
 * simply absent and the surface keeps its plain busy state.
 *
 * A successful install also invalidates the sibling voice caches (['voice','status'],
 * ['voice','config']) — useVoice.ts's own literal query keys, matched here rather than
 * introduced as a second key for the same data — since the install call may newly
 * configure tts.provider/tts.voice (or make the 'local' provider's capabilities
 * non-empty), and both surfaces need to see that immediately, not on their next
 * unrelated refetch.
