/**
 * setExplicitAuthToken — clear-on-failure contract (login-gate honesty).
 *
 * Uses the REAL wrapper (no module mock of './goodvibes') and stubs global fetch so
 * auth.current() sees a daemon that answers but rejects the token (401), instead of
 * hitting a real socket with nothing listening. The token must be stored, then
 * auto-cleared when validation fails, so a bad paste never leaves a lingering
 * credential that makes the shell look signed-in.
 *
 * Why a fetch stub and not a real refused connection: this file used to rely on
 * GOODVIBES_BASE_URL (http://127.0.0.1:3421 outside a browser) having nothing
 * listening, so `sdk.auth.current()`'s real `fetch()` call rejected with
 * ECONNREFUSED and that rejection was what setExplicitAuthToken's catch saw. That
 * real TCP connection attempt raced the test's own lifetime: the fetch promise our
 * code awaits resolves/rejects on the turn we expect, but the underlying socket
 * teardown can surface a SECOND, independent rejection later in the runtime's own
 * internals — observed landing during this test's run and, on a slower CI runner,
 * up to ~24 seconds later while an unrelated suite was executing. That stray
 * rejection is not something this file's own promises hold a handle to, so nothing
 * in application code can await or abort it — the only fix at the source is to never
 * open the real socket in the first place. Stubbing fetch to answer synchronously
 * (in-process, no I/O) removes the race entirely rather than papering over its timing.
