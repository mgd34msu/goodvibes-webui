/**
 * client-compatibility.ts — this build's own copy of the client-build-floor check.
 *
 * A daemon update swaps the daemon binary. It does not restart the clients already
 * attached to it: this browser tab, opened days earlier, keeps running its own build
 * and keeps participating in shared-session work under whatever rules that build
 * shipped with. A behavioral fix landed in the daemon is invisible for as long as one
 * stale client stays attached. The daemon publishes the minimum client build it will
 * accept as a full participant as the `X-Goodvibes-Client-Floor` response header
 * (CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY_FLOOR_HEADER below); a client below it says so plainly rather
 * than silently executing shared-session work under superseded rules.
 *
 * PROVENANCE: this logic is also implemented in the installed
 * @pellux/goodvibes-sdk (platform/control-plane/client-compatibility.ts,
 * evaluateClientCompatibility/compareBuildVersions/readClientCompatibilityFloor) — but
 * that module is exported only through the daemon-facing `@pellux/goodvibes-sdk/platform/control-plane`
 * subpath, whose barrel also carries the gateway/session-broker/route-dispatch server
 * implementation (dispatchDaemonApiRoutes, SharedSessionBroker, ControlPlaneGateway, …),
 * not something this browser bundle should import. No browser-safe subpath exposes it at
 * the installed 2.0.0 pin (re-verified at this pin: `./platform/control-plane` is still
 * the only export surfacing it, and its barrel still carries the full server
 * implementation). This module is a small, independently-tested copy of the same three
 * functions' documented semantics, kept here until a future SDK release exposes them
 * through a seam this app can import directly (a `// SWAP:` seam, same pattern
 * contract-bridge-types.ts uses for a bridge type ahead of its generated counterpart).
 * Re-diffed field-by-field against the 2.0.0 SDK's
 * dist/platform/control-plane/client-compatibility.js at this re-pin: compareBuildVersions
 * and evaluateClientCompatibility are byte-identical in logic (the browser copy's
 * messages say "reload the page" / "Reload from the current install" where the SDK's
 * process-oriented copy says "restart it" — a deliberate, permanent surface-appropriate
 * wording divergence, not drift to fix).
 *
 * ALSO NOTE: at the installed 2.0.0 pin the daemon's own HTTP router still never actually
 * writes this header onto a response — it only threads the constant name partway into an
 * internal context object with no consumer that calls it. So this module has nothing real
 * to read against a live 2.0.0 daemon today; it is exercised here by unit test with a
 * fabricated header, ready for the header the day a daemon actually sends it.
