/**
 * config-ownership.ts — which runtime OWNS a config key, mirrored here for display.
 *
 * The web UI is inherently a REMOTE client: it may run on a different machine
 * from the daemon, so it already does the structurally right thing — every
 * config read/write goes THROUGH the daemon's control plane (config.get /
 * config.set), never by opening a settings file directly. What this module
 * adds is visibility: a user editing `surfaces.telegram.*` or
 * `controlPlane.*` from a browser on another machine needs to see, before they
 * touch it, that the value lands in the DAEMON's own config store and applies
 * to every client — not just this browser tab.
 *
 * Source of truth: the SDK's
 * `packages/sdk/src/platform/config/config-ownership.ts`
 * (`DAEMON_OWNED_CONFIG_PREFIXES` / `DAEMON_OWNED_CONFIG_KEYS` /
 * `DAEMON_OWNED_NON_SCHEMA_CONFIG_PATHS`). This module used to hand-copy those
 * three lists as a comment-enforced "keep in sync by hand" mirror, and it
 * drifted: it was missing the `conversationGate.` and `cluster.` prefixes, and
 * it never carried the non-schema path list at all — so credential paths like
 * `email.passwordRef` and `calendar.google.icsUrl`, which the SDK treats as
 * daemon-owned because the daemon is the only process that can resolve and use
 * them, read as NOT daemon-owned here.
 *
 * That drift never broke routing (routing happens server-side, in the
 * daemon's own daemon-config-route.ts, driven by the SDK's real lists, not
 * this file) — it only made the "Daemon-owned" badge in this UI lie to the
 * operator about which settings the daemon owns.
 *
 * The fix is a build-time generator, not a better comment:
 * `scripts/generate-config-ownership.ts` imports the three lists from the
 * installed `@pellux/goodvibes-sdk/platform/config` at build time (a script
 * that runs under bun, never inside the Vite bundle — the same reason
 * scripts/generate-config-schema.ts snapshots CONFIG_SCHEMA that way instead
 * of importing it live) and snapshots them into
 * `src/lib/generated/config-ownership.ts`. This module re-exports that
 * snapshot and layers the same derived predicate the SDK exposes
 * (`isDaemonOwnedConfigKey`) on top of it, so the browser bundle never pulls
 * in SecretsManager / OAuth / google-auth, and the data itself can no longer
 * silently drift: `bun run config-ownership:check` fails the build the moment
 * the checked-in snapshot disagrees with a fresh regeneration from the
 * installed SDK, exactly like `config-schema:check` already does for
 * CONFIG_SCHEMA.
