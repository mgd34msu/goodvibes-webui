/**
 * insecure-origin.ts — the entry guard for the plain-http-on-a-genuinely-PUBLIC-origin
 * white screen.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS CATCHES: the SDK transport refuses an insecure PUBLIC baseUrl by
 * THROWING at module evaluation (`SDK_TRANSPORT_INSECURE_BASE_URL` in
 * @pellux/goodvibes-transport-http). That throw fires the instant `src/lib/goodvibes.ts`
 * is imported — before React mounts — so an operator who opens the daemon over a plain
 * `http://` public hostname used to get a silent blank `#root` with only a console
 * pageerror. The guard itself is correct (a genuinely public origin is meant to run over
 * HTTPS); the gap was purely the SILENT failure mode.
 *
 * PRIVATE-NETWORK LAN POSTURE (SDK 1.8.0): plain http on a private-network origin —
 * loopback, an RFC 1918 range (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), or an mDNS `.local` name —
 * is a DELIBERATE, SUPPORTED posture (a phone on the same LAN talking to the daemon), not
 * a mistake to wall off: TLS on a home network is the user's own responsibility and the
 * daemon never mints certificates, so the transport WORKS over http there and no longer
 * throws. This wall now fires ONLY for a genuinely public http/ws origin — the browser-
 * gated capabilities (service worker/PWA install, push, microphone) on a private-network
 * http origin instead render as labeled degradation from `pairing.posture.get`
 * (src/hooks/useOriginPosture.ts), never a dead button and never this wall.
 *
 * So this module re-derives the SAME public/private-network boundary the transport uses
 * (`isPrivateNetworkHost`, packages/transport-http/src/paths.ts) WITHOUT importing
 * lib/goodvibes (importing it would re-trigger the very throw we are trying to get ahead
 * of, and pulling in the SDK package here at all would be pointless weight for a guard
 * that must run before anything else). main.tsx checks `isInsecureTransportOrigin()`
 * FIRST and, when true, renders the honest HTTPS message instead of importing App at all.
