/**
 * knowledge-projection.test.ts
 *
 * Every check below has a case where the honest answer is "no". The two the
 * 1.19.1 re-pin exists to expose are the ones worth stating plainly:
 *
 *   - a kind this build has never heard of must NOT be sent, and must not be
 *     reported as a generic request failure either;
 *   - an issue/node/rollup/source projection with no id must NOT be sent, since
 *     the contract's own discriminated union requires one and the daemon was
 *     already refusing it.
 *
 * Both used to compile and ship, because the pre-1.19.1 input type for this
 * method was a permissive index signature.
