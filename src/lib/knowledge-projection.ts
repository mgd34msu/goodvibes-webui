/**
 * knowledge-projection.ts — turning a projection target the daemon listed into a
 * request `knowledge.projection.render` will actually accept.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT FOUR LINES IN THE VIEW: before the 1.19.1 SDK
 * re-pin, `OperatorMethodInput<'knowledge.projection.render'>` resolved to a
 * permissive `{ [k: string]: unknown }` fallback, so KnowledgeView built its
 * payload as `{ kind, ...(id ? { id } : {}), limit }` and the compiler had
 * nothing to say about it. The contract now describes the method properly, and
 * it is stricter than that payload in two independent ways:
 *
 *   1. `kind` is a closed union of seven values. Anything else — including a
 *      kind a NEWER daemon invents — is not a valid request.
 *   2. `id` is not uniformly optional. The input is a discriminated union: a
 *      bundle/dashboard/overview projection takes no id, while an
 *      issue/node/rollup/source projection REQUIRES one.
 *
 * So a source-kind target whose id could not be read produced a request the
 * daemon was always going to reject, and the view could only report that as a
 * generic failure. Both cases now fail loudly and specifically, and neither is
 * resolved by casting: casting `kind` back to the contract type would send the
 * rejected value anyway, which is the blindness the re-pin removes.

 *
 * The mapped type is doing real work in both directions, which is why this is
 * not a plain `Record<ProjectionKind, boolean>`:
 *   - every ProjectionKind must appear, so a kind ADDED by a future SDK is a
 *     missing-property compile error rather than a target that quietly stops
 *     being renderable;
 *   - each value's type is pinned to whether that kind is in
 *     IdRequiredProjectionKind, so an entry that disagrees with the contract is
 *     also a compile error. Without that, this table would be a hand-maintained
 *     opinion while `kindNeedsId` below — a type predicate — stayed free to lie.
 *
 * Both directions were verified by breaking them and watching tsc fail, not
 * assumed from reading the type.
