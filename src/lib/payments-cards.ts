/**
 * payments-cards.ts — the pure half of card entry on THIS surface: which
 * surface we are, whether the SDK's allowlist lets a card be typed here, and
 * how a typed draft becomes the `payments.cards.create` input the daemon
 * accepts. No React, no I/O — so every rule below is unit-testable without a
 * DOM or a daemon.
 *
 * ── Why the webui may take a card at all ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The owner was asked directly whether the webui should accept raw card
 * details, with the exposure stated in front of him (a PAN on a browser page,
 * form autofill, password managers, browser history, XSS in our own UI). He
 * chose the option labelled "Card entry in webui too", and then wrote:
 *
 *   "so is the webui getting card input? i said yes..."
 *
 * Recorded in the SDK as docs/decisions/2026-07-27-card-entry-surfaces.md, and
 * enforced in code by `platform/payments/entry-surface.ts` — whose
 * CARD_ENTRY_SURFACES allowlist is the authority this module defers to. The
 * surface list is NEVER duplicated here: `mayEnterCardDetailsHere()` asks the
 * SDK. If a later ruling closes the webui again, that one edit in the SDK
 * turns this whole surface off, with no webui change and no stale copy to miss.
 *
 * ── The six conditions came WITH the ruling ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The option he selected carried them; they are part of what he chose, not
 * advice added afterwards. The SDK ships them as `WEBUI_CARD_ENTRY_CONDITIONS`
 * so no surface can implement a weaker version — but that export is not in the
 * SDK version this app pins (see the note on CARD_ENTRY_CONDITIONS below), so
 * the text is mirrored here verbatim and pinned by a test against the SDK's
 * copy the moment the pin catches up.
 *
 * A browser adds attack surface a terminal does not, which is exactly why the
 * conditions arrived attached to the ruling rather than after it.
