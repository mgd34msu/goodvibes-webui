/**
 * presentation-bridge.ts — the semantic bridge from web UI status vocabulary
 * onto the SDK presentation contract's glyphs (@pellux/goodvibes-sdk/platform/presentation),
 * the same contract the TUI and agent already render through.
 *
 * HAND-WRITTEN, not generated — see src/lib/generated/presentation-tokens.ts
 * for the literal, checked-in snapshot this module reads from (produced by
 * scripts/generate-presentation-tokens.ts). This file owns the MAPPING
 * decisions; the generated module owns the raw contract DATA.
 *
 * Why a mapping layer at all, instead of repainting the web UI onto the
 * contract's own colors: the contract defines four severity buckets
 * (good / warn / bad / info — STATE_GLYPHS) plus a richer 16-key status
 * glyph vocabulary (GLYPHS.status). The web UI's own status vocabularies
 * (StatusBadge's free-text tone classification, the daemon-health axes in
 * daemon-health.ts) are HONEST, more specific labels than those four
 * buckets afford — "expiring" is genuinely more precise than "warn",
 * "Reachable" is deliberately not "Connected" (see daemon-health.ts). This
 * module keeps that wording exactly as-is and layers the CONTRACT'S GLYPH
 * on top of it, so the same visual glyph vocabulary the TUI/agent use shows
 * up here too, without inventing a wording correspondence that doesn't
 * genuinely exist.
 *
 * A webui state with no honest SDK-contract analogue is not force-fit here
 * (e.g. "unconfigured" / "status unavailable" are absent-health states, not
 * a severity level — they map to `info`, matching STATE_GLYPHS' own "this
 * isn't a fault" bucket, never to `bad`).
