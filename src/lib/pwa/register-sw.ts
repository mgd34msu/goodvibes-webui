/**
 * register-sw.ts — install the service worker (public/sw.js) at the root scope.
 *
 * Called once from main.tsx. Registration is gated on:
 *   - a production build (the SW caches immutable /assets/* — pointless and
 *     HMR-hostile in a normal dev session), OR the VITE_ENABLE_SW=1 escape
 *     hatch the Playwright harness sets so the SW can be exercised headlessly
 *     against the dev server;
 *   - service-worker support in the browser;
 *   - a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) — a service worker cannot register
 *     over plain HTTP to a LAN IP, so we simply skip it there rather than
 *     throwing. The push settings surface explains the HTTPS requirement.
 *
 * Registration never blocks or breaks the app: a failure is logged and swallowed.
