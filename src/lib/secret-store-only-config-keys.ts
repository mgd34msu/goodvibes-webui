/**
 * secret-store-only-config-keys.ts — config keys a `config.set` write cannot
 * actually configure, no matter what value is sent.
 *
 * GROUNDED: for most secret-shaped config keys (surfaces.slack.botToken,
 * surfaces.telegram.botToken, ...), the daemon's own read path
 * (`resolveSecretInput` in the SDK's secret-refs.ts) accepts EITHER a
 * `goodvibes://…`/`env:…`/etc. secret reference OR a literal string — a
 * literal token pasted through `config.set` is read back and used as-is. For
 * those keys, config.set is a real, working write path (SettingsField.tsx's
 * ordinary masked-secret editor is correct for them).
 *
 * The daemon's own mailbox and calendar passwords are NOT like that. Their
 * resolvers deliberately never read a literal from config at all:
 *
 *   - `surfaces.email.password` / `.imapPassword` / `.imap.password` /
 *     `.smtp.password` — packages/sdk/src/platform/email/surface-config.ts:
 *     "Every password is fetched from the secret store under the name the
 *     config key derives (`daemonSecretKeyFor`), never read out of a settings
 *     file." `readSurfaceEmailSettings` does not even attempt to read these
 *     keys as config strings — only host/port/user/from are read that way.
 *   - `surfaces.calendar.caldavPassword` —
 *     packages/sdk/src/platform/calendar/caldav-gateway-config.ts:
 *     "A raw password pasted into config resolves to nothing rather than
 *     being used, which is deliberate: a credential in a settings file is a
 *     credential in every backup of it." A literal value stored there is
 *     first tried as a secret-store REFERENCE (so it resolves to nothing
 *     unless it happens to name a real stored secret) and then as a
 *     config-derived secret lookup (also empty, since nothing was ever
 *     written under that name) — so the calendar reports
 *     `CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_MISSING` regardless of what was "saved".
 *
 * So a `config.set` on one of these keys does two bad things at once: it
 * writes the operator's real password into the daemon's plaintext config
 * file (a credential in every backup of that file, per the CalDAV module's
 * own words), and it configures nothing, because the mail/calendar reader
 * never looks at that value. The UI reporting "Saved — stored in ..." on
 * that write is a lie by omission.
 *
 * There is no operator-exposed RPC that can write into the daemon's secret
 * store instead (searched the SDK's control-plane method catalog —
 * `method-catalog-admin.ts` exposes `credentials.get`, read-only, and no
 * `secrets.set`/`secrets.write` method at all). So the honest behavior for a
 * REMOTE browser client — which can only ever reach the daemon over this
 * wire — is to refuse the write for these keys and name the real mechanism:
 * setting the credential from a terminal with daemon access, which is where
 * `/secrets set` (the mechanism `surface-config.ts` and
 * `caldav-gateway-config.ts` both describe as "where setup stores it") is
 * available.
