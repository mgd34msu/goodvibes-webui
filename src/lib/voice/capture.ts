/**
 * capture.ts — the ONE browser microphone path, shared by both voice consumers.
 *
 * This is the web UI's implementation of the SDK's `AudioCaptureOpener`
 * (@pellux/goodvibes-sdk/platform/voice/capture): the SDK owns the frame
 * contract, the utterance policy and the WAV encoding; the surface owns opening
 * a device. Two consumers sit on this one opener and they must not each open
 * their own stream:
 *
 *   - push-to-talk dictation (MicButton -> useVoiceInput -> PushToTalkSession),
 *   - always-on wake-word detection (wake-host.ts -> WakeListener), which on a
 *     confirmed wake keeps the SAME stream and records the utterance that
 *     follows.
 *
 * Two concurrent getUserMedia streams on one device is the bug this file exists
 * to make impossible, so nothing here is exported as "open a second stream" —
 * mic-arbiter.ts wraps this opener and is what the two consumers actually call.
 *
 * THE FRAME CONTRACT IS LOAD-BEARING AND ITS FAILURES ARE SILENT
 *
 * `onFrame` must deliver exactly `request.frameSamples` samples (1280 = 80 ms at
 * 16 kHz) of mono audio carrying int16 MAGNITUDES as floats (-32768..32767), not
 * the -1..1 range Web Audio hands out. That is the scale openWakeWord trained the
 * shipped classifier against: feeding it normalised audio produces scores that
 * never reach any threshold, which looks exactly like a microphone that is not
 * picking anything up. So every sample is multiplied by 32768 on the way through,
 * and the worklet's render quanta are re-cut by the SDK's `AudioFrameSlicer`
 * rather than assumed to be frame-sized (they are 128 samples).
 *
 * SAMPLE RATE IS ASKED FOR AND THEN VERIFIED
 *
 * `getUserMedia` is asked for 16 kHz mono and the AudioContext is constructed at
 * 16 kHz so the graph resamples deterministically — but a browser may ignore
 * either. `audioContext.sampleRate` is READ, and when it is not 16 kHz the frame
 * pump resamples to 16 kHz itself rather than handing the detector audio at the
 * wrong rate (which shifts the whole front end off the framing the classifier was
 * trained at, and again fails silently).
 *
 * Every failure is an `AudioCaptureError` with a named reason, so the surface can
 * render the specific honest state — the plain-http pointer, the blocked
 * permission, the device that is already held — instead of one dead button.
