/**
 * mic-arbiter.ts — one device, two consumers, one policy for who holds it.
 *
 * Wake detection holds the microphone continuously for as long as the user has
 * it on. Push-to-talk dictation wants the same device, on a keypress, right now.
 * Without an arbiter both call `getUserMedia` and the tab ends up with two live
 * streams on one input: on some platforms the second open fails, on others it
 * succeeds and the two consumers fight over gain and device state. Either way
 * the user sees a microphone that "sometimes does not work".
 *
 * THE POLICY, stated once so it is not re-decided per call site:
 *
 *   Push-to-talk WINS, by suspending wake detection first.
 *
 * A deliberate press is the user asking for the microphone now, so dictation
 * takes it. The wake listener is stopped — really stopped, device released —
 * before the dictation stream is opened, and restarted when dictation finishes,
 * including when it fails. The alternative (dictation refusing while wake holds
 * the device) makes the headline affordance stop working the moment the always-on
 * feature is switched on, which is worse than a two-second gap in detection.
 *
 * Both consumers go through {@link MicArbiter.openCapture}, and it REFUSES a
 * second concurrent open with `device-unavailable` rather than allowing it. That
 * refusal is the invariant this file exists for: any future third consumer is
 * caught by it instead of quietly doubling the streams.
