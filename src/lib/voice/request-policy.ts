/**
 * request-policy.ts — the bounded spoken-output request policy, client-side.
 *
 * The TUI and agent now ship a spoken-output request policy with three properties, and
 * the browser must behave the same way so a spoken reply sounds identical across
 * surfaces:
 *
 *   1. COALESCE TO THE FEWEST REQUESTS — a reply is split into as few synthesis requests
 *      as possible (only split when a single request would exceed the provider's
 *      comfortable length), so a short or medium reply is one request, not many.
 *   2. CAP CONCURRENCY AT 2 — never more than two synthesis requests in flight at once,
 *      so a long reply does not fan out into a burst the provider rate-limits.
 *   3. TRANSIENT-429 RETRY WITH HONEST SKIP-AND-CONTINUE — a request that comes back 429
 *      (rate limited) is retried with backoff; if it still fails after the retries, that
 *      one segment is SKIPPED and the rest of the reply still plays, and the skip is
 *      reported honestly (never silently dropped, never aborting the whole reply).
 *
 * PROVENANCE / INTENDED REFACTOR: the same policy is being hoisted into the SDK on the
 * next minor track. When that lands and this repo's SDK pin bumps to it, this module is
 * meant to be replaced by adopting the hoisted policy — the semantics here are the
 * contract to preserve across that swap. Until then this is the single client-side
 * implementation, unit-tested against all three properties.
