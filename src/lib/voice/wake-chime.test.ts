/**
 * wake-chime.ts — the sound a confirmed wake makes.
 *
 * Worth its own tests for one reason: the host reports "this tab could not play the
 * activation chime" based on this function's return value, so a chime that silently
 * failed while claiming to have played would make a silent wake look like a working
 * one. That is the state the whole activation-sound row exists to avoid.
