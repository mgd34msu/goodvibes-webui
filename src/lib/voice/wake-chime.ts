/**
 * wake-chime.ts — the sound a confirmed wake makes.
 *
 * Audible confirmation is how a user knows the microphone acted; a silent wake is
 * the behaviour people distrust, which is why `voice.wake.activationSound`
 * defaults to "chime" rather than "none". A tab cannot read
 * `voice.wake.activationSoundPath` off the user's disk, so the settings resolver
 * has already downgraded a "custom" choice to "chime" and recorded that as a
 * limitation — this module only ever plays the built-in one.
 *
 * Synthesised with two short oscillator notes rather than shipped as an audio
 * asset: it is 200 ms of two sine tones, and a bundled file would be a network
 * fetch in front of the one piece of feedback that has to be immediate.
