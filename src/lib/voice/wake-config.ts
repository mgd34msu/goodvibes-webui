/**
 * wake-config.ts — `voice.wake.*` as this surface resolves it.
 *
 * The daemon's `config.get` answers the WHOLE config tree as nested objects; the
 * SDK's `resolveWakeRuntimeSettings` reads FLAT dotted keys. This is the adapter
 * between them, plus the one honest statement of what a browser tab can do.
 *
 * None of the capability answers is a guess:
 *   - speexAvailable — asked of the SDK, not declared here. The filter is a
 *     WebAssembly module the SDK carries, so the only question is whether this
 *     runtime has WebAssembly, which a tab does: `voice.wake.noiseSuppression:
 *     "speex"` RUNS here, applied by the wrapper inside WakeListener and
 *     PushToTalkSession.
 *   - vadAvailable — follows the daemon's `voice.wake.status`, because the speech
 *     gate is its own pinned artifact. Provisioned, `voice.wake.vadThreshold`
 *     above 0 screens frames; missing, it BLOCKS rather than scoring ungated
 *     behind a row that claims otherwise.
 *   - canRetainAudio — a tab has no filesystem to retain a clip to.
 *   - canPlayLocalFile — a tab cannot read an absolute path on the user's machine,
 *     so a custom activation sound downgrades to the built-in chime.
 *
 * The resolver turns the last two into `limitations` (the detector still runs and
 * says which row is not in force) and the first two into `blockers` (the detector
 * does not start). Only `.active` decides whether a device is opened.
