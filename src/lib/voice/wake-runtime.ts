/**
 * wake-runtime.ts — onnxruntime-web, adapted to the engine's session shape.
 *
 * The SDK's wake engine never imports an inference runtime. It declares the shape
 * of one (`WakeInferenceSession`) and the host supplies it, which is what lets the
 * same engine run in a daemon child process and in this tab. This file is that
 * supply on the browser side.
 *
 * ONE ENGINE BINARY SERVES BOTH VALUES OF `voice.wake.browserBackend`.
 *
 * onnxruntime-web ships a separate wasm binary per backend set, and this file used
 * to ship two of them: the wasm-only build for `wasm` and the WebGPU build for
 * `webgpu`. That put 38 MB of engine in the built assets to serve a tab that
 * fetches at most one of them.
 *
 * The WebGPU build CONTAINS THE CPU ENGINE TOO, so the second file bought nothing.
 * Verified rather than assumed: a session created from that binary with
 * `executionProviders: ['wasm']` loads and scores the real pinned classifier. So
 * both settings resolve to the one WebGPU-capable binary:
 *   - 'wasm'   -> executionProviders ['wasm']            (CPU provider inside it)
 *   - 'webgpu' -> executionProviders ['webgpu', 'wasm']  (GPU provider, CPU behind)
 * Both values keep working and keep meaning what they say; what changed is that
 * they no longer imply two downloads. Nothing is fetched at all until wake
 * detection is switched on, because the import is dynamic.
 *
 * In onnxruntime-web 1.27 the file the WebGPU entry loads is
 * `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm` — WebGPU execution is asynchronous, so
 * the WebGPU-capable build is the asyncify one. It is referenced through the
 * package's exports map, so the filename is not hardcoded anywhere but here.
 *
 * WebGPU is still capability-checked against `navigator.gpu` before it is
 * selected, and when it is absent the tab falls back to the CPU provider IN THE
 * SAME BINARY — no second fetch, no reload — and SAYS SO as a limitation. The
 * engine's measured cost is ~3.5 ms per 80 ms frame on a single wasm thread, so
 * the fallback is a real fallback and not a degraded-to-unusable one.
 *
 * THREADS ARE NOT ASSUMED. Multi-threaded wasm needs SharedArrayBuffer, which
 * needs cross-origin isolation, which needs COOP/COEP response headers the daemon
 * does not send. `numThreads` is therefore pinned to 1 unless the tab reports
 * `crossOriginIsolated`, rather than left at the library default of "as many as
 * the system has" — which on a non-isolated origin means a failed initialisation.
