/**
 * mount-app.tsx — the normal (secure-context) app boot: QueryClient + <App/> + SW.
 *
 * Split out of main.tsx so it is imported DYNAMICALLY, only after the entry guard
 * (src/lib/insecure-origin.ts) has cleared the origin. App's import graph pulls in
 * src/lib/goodvibes.ts, which constructs the SDK transport and THROWS at module
 * evaluation on an insecure non-local origin — importing it eagerly is exactly what made
 * that failure a silent white screen. Keeping this behind a dynamic import means the
 * throwing graph is never evaluated on the origins where the guard shows its message.
