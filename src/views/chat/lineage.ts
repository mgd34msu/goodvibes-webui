/**
 * lineage.ts — the honest-lineage view model for companion chat.
 *
 * The daemon never deletes conversation history. When a response is regenerated or a
 * message is edited and the conversation branches, the affected messages are marked
 * SUPERSEDED (a `supersededAt` timestamp + a `supersededReason`) and RETAINED in the
 * message list — `companion.chat.messages.list` returns them alongside the active chain.
 * A replacement user message additionally carries `revisionOf` back to the original it
 * was edited from.
 *
 * This module turns that flat, server-authoritative list into a render model that keeps
 * the promise the SDK makes: the active conversation reads cleanly, and every superseded
 * message stays VIEWABLE as retained history rather than silently vanishing. Because the
 * model is derived purely from the server list (not from ephemeral client state), it
 * survives reloads and reflects exactly what the daemon retained.
 *
 * Grouping rule: a superseded message is a fork's old branch. A contiguous run of
 * superseded messages is attached to the next ACTIVE message that follows it — that
 * active message is the fork's new branch head (the regenerated response, or the edited
 * user message). The UI renders the active message normally and offers to reveal the
 * attached retained history inline.
